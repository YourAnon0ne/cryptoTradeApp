  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: ubuntu
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/ubuntu.ttf
        # - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
          # style: italic
    # - family: Montserrat
    #   fonts:
    #     - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat.ttf
